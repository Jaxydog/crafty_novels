///
/// Opens with the following:
///
/// ```html
/// <!DOCTYPE html>
/// <html lang="en" dir="ltr">
/// <head>
///     <meta charset="utf-8" />
/// ```
///
/// At this point, [metadata][`crate::syntax::Metadata`] is written:
///
/// ```html
///     <title>{title}</title>
///     <meta name="author" content="{author}" />

/// And the `<head>` is closed and the contents are opened:
///
/// ```html
///     <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" /
/// </head>
/// <body>
///     <article style=white-space:break-spaces>
/// ```
///
/// Inside of the contents:
///
/// - Plain text are written as [HTML entities][`syntax::HtmlEntity`] where applicable
/// - Spaces are written as just plain spaces: `' '` (without the `'`)
///     - `<article>` having the style `white-space:break-spaces` (mostly) preserves the spaces
///       without the need for `&nbsp;`
/// - Line breaks and paragraph breaks are represented by `<br />`
/// - Thematic breaks are represented by `<hr />`
/// - Colored text is represented as `<span style='color:{color}'>`
///     - Where `color` is a hexademical representation of the color, ex. `#FFFFFF` for pure white
/// - Obfuscated text is represented as `<code>`
/// - Bold text is represented as `<b>`
/// - Strikethrough text is represented as `<s>`
/// - Underline text is represented as `<u>`
/// - Italic text is represented as `<i>`
///
/// And finally, the contents are closed:
///
/// ```html
///     </article>
/// </body>
/// </html>
/// ```
